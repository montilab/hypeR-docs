<p>Geneset enrichment is an important step in many biological data analysis workflows, particularly in bioinformatics and computational biology. At a basic level, one is testing if a group of genes is overrepresented in a series of pre-defined sets of genes, which typically signify some biological relevance. The R package hypeR enables users to easily perform this type of analysis via a hypergeometric test with a focus on easing downstream visualization, analysis, and reporting. Additionally, users can use custom genesets that are easily defined, extending the analysis of genes to other areas of interest such as proteins, microbes, metabolites etc. The hypeR package is designed to make routine geneset enrichment seamless for scientist working in R.</p>

<p>One can visualize the top enriched pathways using <strong><em>hyp_emap</em></strong> which will return an enrichment map. Each node represents a geneset, where the shade of red indicates the normalized significance of enrichment. Hover over the node to view the raw value. Edges represent geneset similarity, calculated by either jaccard or overlap similarity metrics.</p>

<p>When dealing with hundreds of genesets, itâ€™s often useful to understand the relationships between them. This allows researchers to summarize many enriched pathways as more general biological processes. To do this, we rely on curated relationships defined between them. For example, <a href="https://reactome.org/">REACTOME</a> conveniently defines their genesets in a <a href="https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/">hiearchy of pathways</a>. This data can be formatted into a relational genesets object called <strong><em>rgsets</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Other times we are looking at multiple signatures that may have been defined in a single experiment. In this case, we can feed <strong><em>hypeR</em></strong> a named list of signatures and a <strong><em>multihyp</em></strong> object will be returned. This object is essentially just multiple <strong><em>hyp</em></strong> objects. However it is recognized and handled differently by downstream visualization and analysis tools.</p>

<p><strong><em>hyp_to_rmd</em></strong> will accept multiple formats, including a single <strong><em>hyp</em></strong> or <strong><em>multihyp</em></strong> objects as well as a list of either, including a list of <strong><em>hyp</em></strong> or <strong><em>multihyp</em></strong> objects together. When a list of <strong><em>multihyp</em></strong> objects are passed for example, each experiment will become its own section, while each signature becomes its own tab within that section. Lists of keyword arguments can be passed for <strong><em>hyp_plot</em></strong>, <strong><em>hyp_emap</em></strong>, and <strong><em>hyp_hmap</em></strong>, allowing customization of their functionality per report.</p>
