<p>Other times we are looking at multiple signatures that may have been defined in a single experiment. In this case, we can feed <strong><em>hypeR</em></strong> a named list of signatures and a <strong><em>multihyp</em></strong> object will be returned. This object is essentially just multiple <strong><em>hyp</em></strong> objects. However it is recognized and handled differently by downstream visualization and analysis tools.</p>
