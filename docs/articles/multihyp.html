<p>Other times we are looking at multiple signatures that may have been defined in a single experiment. In this case, we can feed <code>hypeR</code> a named list of signatures and a <code>multihyp</code> object will be returned. This object is essentially just multiple <code>hyp</code> objects. However it is recognized and handled differently by downstream visualization and analysis tools.</p>
