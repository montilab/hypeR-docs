<a href="#relational-genesets" class="anchor"></a>Relational genesets</h4>
<p>When dealing with hundreds of genesets, it’s often useful to understand the relationships between them. This allows researchers to summarize many enriched pathways as more general biological processes. To do this, we rely on curated relationships defined between them. For example, <a href="https://reactome.org/">REACTOME</a> conveniently defines their genesets in a <a href="https://reactome.org/PathwayBrowser/">hiearchy of pathways</a>. This data can be formatted into a relational genesets object called <code>rgsets</code>.</p>

<p>Relational genesets have three data atrributes including gsets, nodes, and edges. The <code>gsets</code> attribute includes the geneset information for the leaf nodes of the hiearchy, the <code>nodes</code> attribute describes all nodes in the hiearchical, including internal nodes, and the <code>edges</code> attribute describes the edges in the hiearchy.</p>
